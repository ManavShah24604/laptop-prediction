# Laptop Prediction Model

## Overview

The Laptop Prediction Model is a machine learning model designed to predict and recommend suitable laptop choices based on user preferences, requirements and budget. This model utilizes a vast dataset of laptops with various features and specifications to provide accurate and personalized laptop prices.

## How It Works

The Laptop Prediction Model uses a combination of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms to make predictions. It takes into account several essential factors, such as processor, RAM, storage capacity, graphics card, display size, battery life, and other user preferences. 

## Requirements

To run the Laptop Prediction Model, you'll need the following:

1. Python 3.x or higher
2. Required Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, etc.)
3. A dataset of laptops with relevant features and user ratings

## Installation

1. Clone or download the Laptop Prediction Model repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/ManavShah24604/laptop-prediction).

2. Install the required Python libraries using the following command:


3. Prepare your laptop dataset in CSV format, ensuring it contains all necessary features for making predictions.

## Usage

1. Ensure that your laptop dataset is placed in the same directory as the model script.

2. Run the model script using the following command:


3. The model will prompt you to input your preferences for each feature, such as processor, RAM, storage capacity, etc.

4. After providing all preferences, the model will calculate the best match and recommend the most suitable laptops based on your input.

5. The model will also display a confidence score indicating the reliability of the recommendations.

## Model Tuning

If you wish to fine-tune the Laptop Prediction Model, you can modify the hyperparameters and algorithm selection in the script. Additionally, updating the dataset with new laptop entries and user feedback will further improve the model's accuracy.

## Acknowledgments

The Laptop Prediction Model was developed by Manav Shah. We would like to acknowledge the contributions of various open-source libraries, as well as the laptop manufacturers and the community for providing the necessary data to build this model.

## Disclaimer

Please note that the Laptop Prediction Model is designed to provide recommendations based on historical data and user preferences. While it strives to offer accurate suggestions, the final decision to purchase a laptop should be based on personal research and considerations.

## Progress
It is left to implement. I am currently working to increase the accuracy of the model. I have achieved roughtly around 91%. Laptop prices prizes vary highly due to offers, sales, etc. So it is kinda tough to implement.
